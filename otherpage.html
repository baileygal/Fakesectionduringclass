        According to Trip Advisor, these are the best restaurants in local Milan.

    <ul>
        Panigacci
        Pyt Milano
        Cantine Milano
        
    </ul>
    <h2>Panigacci</h2>
    Aperitif • Dinner • Cocktail Bar Much more than a Bistro: <br>
    in the wake of the historic Lunigiana sandwich-based restaurant, a new concept of a multi-purpose venue is born which ranges from the aperitif, <br>
    to the small restaurant with sung dinner or à la carte to the cocktail bar. An unconventional place to feel at home. Point of reference for a young<br>
     but demanding clientele and for those looking for an "IN" place to spend an evening or celebrate an important event.
     <br><br>
     <h3>Pyt Milano</h3>
     PYT Milano is an exclusive restaurant where you can enjoy dinner shows every evening worthy of being remembered and told. <br>
     Shows with which to transform a simple dinner into an experience capable of involving and inebriating all five senses, <br>
     immersive experiences capable of making you forget the stress of everyday life, eclectic dimensions with which to enter a new reality. <br>
     An à la carte menu, a selection of bottles capable of giving you true sensorial experiences, always different shows with exceptional performers. <br>
     PYT is the dining place where every desire to escape from reality is realized: an exclusive place, a place in which to live the most EXTRAORDINARY EXPERIENCE.
     <br><br>
     <h4>Cantine Milano</h4>
     Cantine Milano is the first and only Italian Wine Restaurant where the experience begins with a passionate choice of wine, and only then is paired <br>
     with the perfect food! Our menu is a real sensorial journey that explores innovative pairings, with wine guiding every gastronomic choice. <br>
     The cuisine, inspired by the Mediterranean tradition, is revisited in a gourmet key to enhance every sip and every dish. Every visit to Cantine Milano promises to be an <br>
     extraordinary culinary experience, where wine is not just an accompaniment, but the absolute protagonist.
